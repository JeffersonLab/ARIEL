There is one mutable data members:
      mutable std::string what_;

To remove the mutability of the what_ data member, it is probably
necessary to make explain_self() non-const. This would be hard.

THREADING

We can just avoid sharing exceptions objects between threads. We need
to be aware of exceptions stored in one thread and transferred to
another, to make sure the handoff is OK.
