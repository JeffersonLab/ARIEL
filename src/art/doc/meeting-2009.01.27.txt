mu2e 2009.01.27 meeting

What is working?
  - services
  - read/write root files
  - initial runtime
  - initial build
      -- with some warnings???  (during complete rebuild)
  - external products
  - build with debug/symbol table (-g)   flag for runtime bounds checking??
               NOT A COMPILER FLAG, But rather a stl prepocessor directive
	                           _GLIBCXX_DEBUG_???

What is not working?
   - high-level "instruction for use" web page
   - external products in AFS space? (Linux, gcc 4.1.2)
   - test suite
   - STL with bounds checking (_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_ activates this)
   - Base Release that can be used without entire checkout/build
   - skeleton "package" generator (include example)

Where do some problems lie?
   - plugin manager
   - "main" routine (symbol table troubles)


Work for this week
1   - toy  Rob's example coded  + sinpler example (histogram integers)

                                                                      2nd Run needed?

4   - External product install in AFS area

Work for after this week
   - restructure directories
   - initial feature stripping (1. backward compat, 2. classes that are baggage, 3. scheduling issue)
   - product-to-product reference (class)   hits (product), track(product) with 10 hits refers back to hits,
                                                            higher level association class(product)

Repository for code
   - redmine/trac?

devisions of code (code types)
  1 *infra code       (event, rough vector
  2 *main (body of) experiment   (jet finding, track finding, main monte carlo, main reconstruction)
  3 user    (my analysis, "quick side study")

* - needs to always be working
