Description:

gallery reads data produced using the art framework. It
is considered "lite" compared to the art framework and
is not capable of doing many of the things one can do
with art, the most significant being that it cannot
produce art formatted output files. It's primary
use would be a simple way to read over art input files
and produce histograms or ntuples that could be saved
in a simple ROOT format file. It could be useful for other
purposes. It has the advantage that in addition to being
built as an executable, it can run as a ROOT script or
via pyROOT. It also does not place the same restrictions
as art on the input files that can be read in one process.
In art there are requirements that all the input files
have to have similar branches and BranchIDLists.
One does not have to install or setup art to run gallery,
although both art and gallery depend on canvas.
One would not want to use gallery for processes like
fully running reconstruction for an experiment, only
simpler and less complex tasks.

art is an event-processing framework for particle physics experiments. 
Experiments use the art framework to build programs that process data 
in a variety of contexts.
