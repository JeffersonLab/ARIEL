* `cet::split_by_regex()`{.cpp} operates on an `std::string const &`{.cpp} and returns its answer in the form of an `std::vector<std::string>`{.cpp} by value, without threading implications beyond those of possibly acessing the input string while being altered simultanoeously elsewhere, which is the province of the caller.
