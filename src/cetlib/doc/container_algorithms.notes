## Multi-threading analysis of `container_algorithms`{.cpp}

Facilities that wrap the standard algorithms for containers.

None of the algorithms have any local variables; the arguments are just forwarded to the `std` algorithms.  It is incumbent on the caller of these facilities to sort out any threading issues.

No inherent threading issues.
