These tests were inaugurated to investigate and reproduce the isssue reported to LArSoft as https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/23013, eventually reported to ROOT as https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/projects/ROOT/issues/ROOT-10271.

Although part of canvas-root-io, this entire directory can be turned into a standalone reproducer in conjunction with cetmodules with the make_standalone_tarball script in the standalone/ directory, e.g.:

  standalone/make_standalone_tarball -v v1_04_00 ~/test-tarball.tar.bz2

If not specified, the cetmodules version defaults to v1_04_00.

The tarball will contain a single eponymous directory, within which will be:

  build/
  cetmodules/
  io-rules-regression/
  run_standalone*

1. Ensure that suitable versions of CMake and ROOT (and dependenciesâ€”including the compiler) are available. This will likely be done by setting up the relevant UPS products, but anything that puts the right things in PATH, ROOTSYS, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH etc. should work.
2. Ensure CC and CXX have appropriate values in the environment if necessary.
3. Execute the script run_standalone to build and run the tests under build/.
