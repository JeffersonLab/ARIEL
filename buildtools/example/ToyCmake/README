This is a very simple example for cmake.  It will build a library, an executable,
and install files into a directory ready to be tarred up as a relocateable ups product.
Various CET conventions:
1. Include files are of the form #include "MyProduct/MyHeader.h"
2. Source code and headers live in the same directory
3. Supported flavors: 64bit SLF5 and SLF6
4. in a build directory:
   source .../ToyCmake/ups/setup_for_development <-d|-p>
   where -d means debug and -p means profile
   This will establish the build environment so you can then run cmake and make
