This is a very simple example for cmake.
It builds two libraries and an executable.

To use this example:
mkdir <my-empty-directory>
cd <my-empty-directory>
cp -pr $CETBUILDTOOLS_DIR/example/ToyCmake .
mkdir build install
cd build (this is your working directory)
source ../ToyCmake/ups/setup_for_development
   This will setup cmake and gcc v4_5_1
   This will also define CETPKG_TYPE, CETPKG_QUAL, and CETPKG_SOURCE
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=\$CETPKG_TYPE \
      -Dqualifier:STRING=\$CETPKG_QUAL \$CETPKG_SOURCE
make
make test
make install
make package (create a distribution tarball)

See READMEs and comments in the various files for specific information
about customizing for your package.
