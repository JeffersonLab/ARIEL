This directory contains templates for cmake.

To use the templates in this directory,  where XXX is the product name:
1. cp setup_for_development.template <your-source-code>/ups/setup_for_development
2. cp setup_deps.template <your-source-code>/ups/setup_deps
3. cp product-config.cmake.in.template <your-source-code>/ups/product-config.cmake.in
4. cp product_deps.template <your-source-code>/ups/product_deps
5. Edit the list of required products and qualifiers in product_deps
6. The ups convention is that product names will be all lower case.

See example/ToyCmake for a complete example which uses cmake to build hello world
and create a relocateable product tarball.
