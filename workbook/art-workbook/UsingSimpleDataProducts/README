Instructions for this Exercise

Read the slides for Session 14; they accompany this exercise.

The code for this Exercise lives in this directory plus
art-workbook/SimpleDataProducts

In that directory understand, EventSummary.h and EventSummary.cc
Read what the slides have to say about classes_def.xml, classes.h
and CMakeLists.txt

In this directory the files are:
Summary_module.cc
  - This is much like the producer modules you have alread seen
  - The only difference is that is uses the new data product

ReadSummary_module.cc
  - This is like other analyzer modules you have already seen
  - It reads back the new data product and prints it out

Summary2_module.cc
  - Start of your homework.
  - This is the same as Summary1 put it fills the TrackSummary for each
    track, prints out the result and discards it.

CMakeLists.txt
  - Note the addition of art-workbook_SimpleDataProducts to MODULE_LIBRARIES
  - This is the library that holds newly created EventSummaryCollection
  - Otherwise it is the same as the one for the FirstProducer exercise


To run the exercise:

1)
Remind your self of the data products in the input file

art -c fcl/FileDumper/fileDumper.fcl inputFiles/input01.art

2)
Run the first part of the exercise.  Reads the input file, makes
the new data product, adds it to the event and writes out the event:

art -c  fcl/UsingSimpleDataProducts/summary1.fcl

3)
Look at the data products in the output file:

art -c fcl/FileDumper/fileDumper.fcl output/summary1.art

Compare the output to that from step 1.
You should see that the new data product is present
(plus the TriggerResults product created by art in this job)
fcl/UsingSimpleDataProducts/readSummary1.fcl

4)
Read back the new data product from the output file:

art -c  fcl/UsingSimpleDataProducts/readSummary1.fcl

Compare the printout here to the printout from step 2.


5)
Here is a big exercise for you to try.

art -c  fcl/UsingSimpleDataProducts/summary2.fcl

This runs Summary2_module.cc, which exercises TrackSummary.

Create the file:
SimpleDataProducts/TrackSummaryCollection.h

You do not need a matching .cc - understand why.
You can use this as a model
$TOYEXPERIMENT_DIR/source/toyExperiment/MCDataProducts/GenParticleCollection.h

Modify classes_def.xml and classes.h to dictionary entries for the
TrackSummaryCollection data  product

Hint:
 - you need to add 3 lines to classes_def.xmk and 2 lines to classe.sh

Run buildtool to make the dictionaries.

Edit Summary2_module.cc so that it makes a TrackSummaryCollection product
and puts it in the event.

Run buildtool

Run the job:
art -c  fcl/UsingSimpleDataProducts/summary2.fcl

Check that the data product is in the output file:
art -c fcl/FileDumper/fileDumper.fcl output/summary2.art

Write analyzer module to read back the new data product and print it out.
