Range library packaging for ARIEL
================================

This is a packaging wrapper for the experimental
[range v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) for integration into [ARIEL](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/ARIEL).

A top-level CMake list file is provided that interfaces with the included build tools.

The range repository is included as a submodule, currently at version 0.11.0
